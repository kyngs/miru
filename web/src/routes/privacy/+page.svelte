This document outlines the data practices associated with the use of the Miru application, referred to as "the application."

<h3 class='text-white font-weight-bold'>Local Storage of Basic Metadata</h3>The application stores basic metadata locally, and data essential for the BitTorrent protocol to function. This includes:

  <li>Magnet links or torrent URLs</li>
  <li>Information related to the download/upload status of torrent files</li>
  <li>User settings and preferences</li>
</ul>

<h3 class='text-white font-weight-bold'>Third-Party Service - AniList</h3>The application interfaces with AniList (accessible at <a class='hyperlink-underline' href='https://anilist.co/terms'>https://anilist.co/terms</a>), a third-party service. Please refer to AniList's privacy policy to understand the protocols governing data management by this service.

<h3 class='text-white font-weight-bold'>Non-Usage and Non-Sharing of User Data</h3>The application does not utilize or share user data. Personal information is not tracked, stored, or processed in any manner.

<h3 class='text-white font-weight-bold'>Absence of User Action Tracking</h3>The application does not employ mechanisms for tracking or analyzing user actions. User activities within the application are not monitored.

<ul class='text-wrap'>
  <li>IP addresses of connected peers</li>
  <li>Piece information for data integrity verification</li>
  <li>Torrent-related metadata for establishing connections</li>
</ul>

<h3 class='text-white font-weight-bold'>Data Exposed to Other Parties</h3>It is important to note that certain data exposed by the application, as outlined in the above section, can be potentially tracked by other parties participating in the BitTorrent network.

This exposure is inherent to the functionality of the BitTorrent protocol and is beyond the control of the application.
